1. Directories is the way we organize using a hierarchical structure, at the top would be the root directory.

2. VCS is useful for the fact that we are able to test that what we are doing is working, we have a free work space as well as allow us to get comfortable with standard industry tools.

3. My favorite artistic medium would be film, i enjoy when the scene, music and dialog all comes together to make a fantastic film
